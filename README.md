# ProjectileMotion
Predicting the path followed by a projectile using linear regression.

To run:

1. Install Octave (>=3.8.0) or MATLAB.

2. Run predict_projectile.m script in Octave/MATLAB.

3. Train regressor and supply initial velocity and angle when prompted.

The predicted data are stored as csv files with the format predicted_data_number.csv

Thank you!
